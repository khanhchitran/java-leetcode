 

# 🚀 My Java Algorithm and LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my learning process and progress as I focus on mastering **Java** and tackling **LeetCode** problems. 💻

## 🌟 Why I'm Doing This

As a developer, I believe that understanding algorithms and data structures is key to becoming proficient at solving complex problems. By working through these challenges, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and overall coding efficiency in Java.

## 🔥 Current Focus

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** using **Java**
- Practicing **LeetCode** problems regularly
- Implementing brute-force approaches and optimizing over time
- Strengthening my understanding of time and space complexities

## 📈 My Learning Goals

- Solve **100+ LeetCode** problems by the end of [Month/Year]
- Master **Sorting Algorithms**, **Recursion**, and **Dynamic Programming**
- Learn to approach problems with **brute-force** solutions first, then optimize

## 📚 Study Resources

- **Books**: "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- **Platforms**: LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks
- **Mentors**: Online communities and peers

## 🏆 Milestones

- **[Date]**: Solved 10 LeetCode problems (Brute-force approaches)
- **[Date]**: Completed the Array and Strings section in LeetCode
- **[Date]**: Mastered Recursion basics in Java

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Dive deeper into **Dynamic Programming** and **Graph Algorithms**
- Contribute to open-source projects related to algorithms
- Apply these skills in real-world projects and challenges

## 💡 Key Takeaway

Every problem I solve brings me one step closer to becoming a better programmer. It's not just about finding the solution; it's about understanding the process, learning from my mistakes, and growing as a developer.
